Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create a basic statistical analysis of the temperatures on Oahu for the months of June and December. This is to help ascertain if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable on a continous yearly basis. We created a query that captures the temperatures particularly for the months of June and December, we can access information from the database such as average, maximum, and minimum temperatures.

# Results

# June Temperature Analysis
Based on the analysis, we observed there are 1,700 observations for the months of June, between 2010 and 2017. The average, minimum, and maximum temperatures are listed below. The low standard deviation suggests a relatively small spread across the temperature observations. This adds up, as Oahu weather does not fluctuate significantly.

# December Temperature Analysis
Based on the analysis, December have only 1,517 observation. This implies that some of the dates are missing temperature recordings. This is already a large sample size, thus our analysis will still be relatively representative. From the charts, we can see that June and December are similar in average, maximum, and minimum temperature. More significantly, the spread for december is about the same as the spread for the month of June.

# Summary:
By comparing the statistic summary of the two months, we can conclude that temperature patterns remain steady throughout the whole year. Although temperatures maybe steady all round-year, precipitation may not have a significant impact of the business's sustainability. A statistical summary of the precipitation patterns during the months of June and December will provide us with a better picture of the overall weather pattern.

Another query that can help us further our analysis is comparing the most active stations to the weather patterns. This can help us narrow down the best location by giving us the most popular station combined with the most stable weather patterns.
